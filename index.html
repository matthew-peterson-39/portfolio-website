            <p>random words about myself here /l-0 "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
                men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
                they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
                in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
                These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
                untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
                welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
                obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances
                accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects
                pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
